This repo contains code snippets that are used for Mid City Engineering's website. The code files are either visibile on the website via 'Embed Code' widgets that render HTML or they were used for internal demos/sampling and are not visible on the website.

HTML code to render the test script:
1. Using CDN (with caching, better for production) - <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Evaan2001/Odoo@main/odoo-test-script.js"></script>
2. Using githack (with no caching, better for quick testing) - <script src="https://raw.githack.com/Mid-City-Engineering/Website_Helper_Code/main/simple-test.js"></script>
