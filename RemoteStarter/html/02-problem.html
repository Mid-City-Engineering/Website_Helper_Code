<!-- Problem Section HTML -->
<section class="problem-section" id="problem">
    <h2 class="universal-section-title">The Traditional Remote Start Nightmare</h2>
    <div class="universal-cards-row">
        <div class="universal-red-card" data-fade-in>
            <div class="icon">🔌</div>
            <h3>Invasive Installation</h3>
            <p>Traditional systems butcher your wiring harness. Say goodbye to your factory warranty and hello to
                electrical gremlins down the road.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="universal-red-card" data-fade-in>
            <div class="icon">🔑</div>
            <h3>Extra Remotes</h3>
            <p>Another bulky fob on your keychain. More batteries to replace. More things to lose. Your key ring becomes
                a jingle bell.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="universal-red-card" data-fade-in>
            <div class="icon">⚠️</div>
            <h3>Reliability Issues</h3>
            <p>Generic remote starts fail constantly. Surprise! Your car won't start on the coldest morning of the year
                when you need it most.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="universal-red-card" data-fade-in>
            <div class="icon">💸</div>
            <h3>Hidden Costs</h3>
            <p>Cheap upfront, expensive repairs later. Plus voided warranties when something breaks. That "deal" isn't
                looking so good now.</p>
        </div>
